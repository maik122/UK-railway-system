If you do not have these libraries installed on your system,
You need to install them  with this line of code :
pip install -r requirements.txt

this will install all the  packages that might not be standard python packages.
or you can activate the virtual environment which has these libraries installed in with this line of code:
source /Users/batman/Desktop/AACoursework_MaiKassem_20015112/.venv/bin/activate
